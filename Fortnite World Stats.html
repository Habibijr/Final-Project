<h1> Nick eh 30 <h1>
<p>
Became a more known streamer because of fortnite. Not as famous as Ninja or Faze tfue, but still good as both of them.
Nick eh 30 is known for his amazing building and editing skills. Building faster then both Tfue and ninja, he wins most of his fights by
gaining advantage over his opponent. He introduced a new way of protecting thyself while geting in a building war. While he building up he sometimes 
he puts a wall infront of him as protection so by chance he happens to get shot, he has protection.If he doesn't get shot, his editing skills 
 fast enough for him that he edited the wall away for him to keep up with the opponents building.
