<h2> Intructions <h2>
Battle Royale utilizes the same core mechanics as Save the World:

Harvest Materials by breaking things with your pickaxe.
Scavenge for weapons and items of varying rarities in treasure chests, ammo boxes, and supply drops;.
Build to defend yourself, move around the map, and attack your opponents.
Survive the storm.
However, in Battle Royale your opponents are not the Husks of Save the World, but other players. 100 players in total enter a matchmaking queue in one of 4-5 game modes (Solo, Duos, Squads, 50v50, and/or a Limited time mode). The arena of play is not a Region but an island with numerous static locations. Players leap out of the Battle Bus as it flies across the map at a random trajectory and choose their own starting point. And instead of the storm being an anomaly on the map that spawns enemies, it is an ever-encroaching mist that encircles the map, doing damage to unfortunate players when it touches them. The last player or group standing is awarded a Victory Royale.
